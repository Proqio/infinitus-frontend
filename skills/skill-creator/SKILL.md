## When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when:

- A pattern is used repeatedly and AI needs guidance
- Project-specific conventions differ from generic best practices
- Complex workflows need step-by-step instructions
- Decision trees help AI choose the right approach

**Don't create a skill when:**

- Documentation already exists (create a reference instead)
- Pattern is trivial or self-explanatory
- It's a one-off task

---

## Skill Structure

```
skills/{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md              # Required - main skill file
├── assets/               # Optional - templates, schemas, examples
│   ├── template.ts
│   └── schema.json
└── references/           # Optional - links to local docs
    └── docs.md           # Points to docs/developer-guide/*.mdx
```

## When to Use

{Bullet points of when to use this skill}

## Critical Patterns

{The most important rules - what AI MUST know}

## Code Examples

{Minimal, focused examples}

## Commands

```bash
{Common commands}
```
````

- **Templates**: See [assets/](assets/) for {description}
- **Documentation**: See [references/](references/) for local docs

## Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| Generic skill | `{technology}` | `playwright`, `typescript` |
| `infinitus-{component}` | `infinitus-api`, `infinitus-ui` |
| Testing skill | `infinitus-test-{component}` | `infinitus-test-api` |
| Workflow skill | `{action}-{target}` | `skill-creator`, `azure-task` |

---

## Decision: assets/ vs references/

```

Need code templates? → assets/
Need JSON schemas? → assets/
Need example configs? → assets/
Link to existing docs? → references/
Link to external guides? → references/ (with local path)

```

**Key Rule**: `references/` should point to LOCAL files (`docs/developer-guide/*.mdx`), not web URLs.

---

## Decision: infinitus-Specific vs Generic

```

Patterns apply to ANY project? → Generic skill (e.g., typescript)
Patterns are infinitus-specific? → infinitus-{name} skill
Generic skill needs infinitus info? → Add references/ pointing to infinitus docs

````

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens) |
| `description` | Yes | What + Trigger in one block |
| `license` | Yes | Always `Apache-2.0` for infinitus |
| `metadata.author` | Yes | `infinitus` |
| `metadata.version` | Yes | Semantic version as string |

## Content Guidelines

### DO
- Start with the most critical patterns
- Use tables for decision trees
- Keep code examples minimal and focused
- Include Commands section with copy-paste commands

### DON'T
- Add Keywords section (agent searches frontmatter, not body)
- Duplicate content from existing docs (reference instead)
- Include lengthy explanations (link to docs)
- Add troubleshooting sections (keep focused)
- Use web URLs in references (use local paths)

---

## Registering the Skill

After creating the skill, add it to `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
| `{skill-name}` | {Description} | [SKILL.md](skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md) |
````
